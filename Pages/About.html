                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>My name is <strong>Joshua Thomas</strong> and I am 19 years old. I am currently a first year student,
                    studying <strong>Cyber Security</strong>. As you can see in my nice little picture and the dark mode
                    version of this Portfolio, I love the colour blue. I also love animals, particularly cats and birds
                    - as they are so fascinating to watch.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>For both my <a class="pdf" href="../Files/GCSE_Certificate.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>GCSE's</strong></a>  <!-- This will open my GCSE certificate in a new page -->
                    and my <a class="pdf" href="../Files/A-Levels_Certificate.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>A-Levels</strong></a>, <!-- This will open my A-Level certificate in a new page -->
                    I studied at <strong>Ysgol Garth Olwg</strong>.
                    My results for both can be viewed in a pdf format by <strong>clicking the purple text</strong>. During my second year
                    of GCSE's, <strong>COVID-19</strong> had fundamentally shut down the world. I was fortunate to
                    have completed coursework for most of my subjects, so my grades were largely unaffected. The same
                    cannot be said for my A-Levels. During the first year of A-Levels, my school struggled to transition
                    to online learning, and by the second year, we were back in school trying to transition back to what
                    the old norm used to be. My grades for subjects that I was weaker in reflect this.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                <p>While studying for my GCSE qualifications, I undertook a work experience week with a company called
                    <strong>Kronos</strong>. Since my work experience, they have now become known as
                    <strong>UKG</strong>. I never had a set role while working, as I would be assigned to different
                    departments each day - learning as to what each does, providing my ideas as well as making a
                    presentation that was used during a board meeting.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>During my second year of A-Levels, I was <strong>working part-time</strong> most weekdays after school had finished in
                    an afterschool club. While here, I would need to provide <strong>childcare</strong>, as well as entertain all of the
                    children. It was a <strong>physically demanding</strong> job, as we would need to set up and then pack up everything
                    in the school hall, and then we would play tag or hide and seek with the kids on the school yard.
                </p>
