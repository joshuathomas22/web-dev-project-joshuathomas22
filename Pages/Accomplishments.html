                                        In 2009, I built my first advanced LEGO set, the Star Wars Millennium Falcon,
                                        which was an exciting experience. I carefully assembled the intricate pieces and
                                        created the spaceship I had always wanted.

                                        Star, following the instructions step by step. We had fun bonding over the
                                        project and admiring our completed masterpiece once it was done.
